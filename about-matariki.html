          <h3>MATARIKI: THE MAORI NEW YEAR</h3>
          <p>
            Matariki is the Māori name for the cluster of stars also known as
            the Pleiades. It rises in midwinter and for many Māori, it heralds
            the start of a new year. Iwi across New Zealand understand and
            celebrate Matariki in different ways and at different times.
          </p>
          <p>
            Matariki is an abbreviation of ‘Ngā Mata o te Ariki Tāwhirimātea
            (‘The eyes of the god Tāwhirimātea’) and refers to a large cluster
            of stars, known in European tradition as the Pleiades. According to
            Māori tradition, the god of the wind, Tāwhirimātea, was so angry
            when his siblings separated their parents, Ranginui the sky father
            and Papatūānuku the earth mother, that he tore out his eyes and
            threw them into the heavens.

          <p>
            Leading Tūhoe astronomer Dr Rangi Matamua says that his tūpuna
            counted nine stars:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <b>Matariki:</b> the star that signifies well-being, reflection,
              hope and the gathering of people; considered to be a female star
              which is the guardian of the other stars in the cluster. The name
              Matariki denotes both this individual star and the whole cluster.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Waitī:</b> the star linked with fresh water and food that comes
              from fresh water.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Waitā</b>: the star linked with the ocean and food that comes
              from it.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Tupuānuku:</b> the star linked with food that grows in the
              ground.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Tupuārangi:</b> the star linked with food that comes from the
              skies: fruits, berries, and birds.
            </li>
            <li><b>Waipunarangi:</b> the star linked with the rain.</li>
            <li>
              <b>Ururangi:</b> the star that determines the winds for the year.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Pōhutukawa:</b> the star associated with those who have died.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Hiwa-i-te-rangi:</b> the star associated with dreams and
              aspirations for the coming year.
            </li>
            <h4>SIGNIFICANCE OF MATARIKI</h4>
            <p>
              Matariki is known as the Māori New Year in Te Ao Māori (the Māori
              world view). Closely connected with the maramataka (the Māori
              lunar calendar), the reappearance of the Matariki stars in the
              early morning sky brings the past year to a close and marks the
              beginning of the new year.
            </p>
            <p>
              Mātauranga Māori (ancestral knowledge and wisdom) is at the heart
              of celebrations of the Matariki public holiday and it will be a
              time for;
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Remembrance</b> – Honouring those we have lost since the last
                rising of Matariki
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Celebrating the present</b> – Gathering together to give
                thanks for what we have
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Looking to the future</b> – Looking forward to the promise of
                a new year
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Historically, the stars of Matariki were also closely tied to
              planting, harvesting and hunting. If the stars appeared clear and
              bright, it signified an abundant season ahead.
            </p>
            <h4>MODERN MATARIKI</h4>
            <p>
              At the beginning of the 21st century Māori began to revive the
              practice of celebrating Matariki as a time of remembrance, joy and
              peace. Iwi, hapu and whānau once again came together at Matariki
              to mourn family members, to share kai, wānanga (have discussions)
              and whakanui (celebrate) within their local community.
            </p>
            <p>
              In 2020, the government announced its intention to establish a
              public holiday during Matariki that recognised and celebrated te
              ao Māori (the Māori world), to be held for the first time in 2022.
              A Matariki Advisory Group was set up to advise ministers on when
              and how the new public holiday should be celebrated. The date of
              the Matariki public holiday will shift each year to align with the
              Māori lunar calendar. It will be observed on a Friday, usually in
              late June or early July. The Advisory Group’s members were drawn
              from across the country to ensure that the mātauranga (knowledge)
              of various iwi was represented.
