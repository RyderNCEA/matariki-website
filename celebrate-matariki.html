          <h3>WAYS TO CELEBRATE</h3>
          <p>
            The Matariki star cluster rises in mid-winter, ushering in the Māori
            New Year. This is a time to celebrate the unique places we live in,
            show respect for the land we live on, and to share and grow together
            through traditions that continue each year. For the first time ever,
            Aotearoa New Zealand celebrated Matariki with a public holiday on
            Friday 24 June 2022.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h4>Attend an event</h4>
          <p>
            There are lots of Matariki festivals and celebrations happening
            around the country such as storytelling, kite-making, performances
            and exhibitions. See what’s happening in your local region or run
            your own event, it could just be with your wider whānau and friends.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h4>Take time to reflect</h4>
          <p>
            Take some time to remember loved ones who have passed away. You can
            do this by reflecting on past events, sharing stories and memories
            with your whānau, visiting their final resting places, lighting a
            candle, talking with friends and whānau or writing down your hopes
            and dreams for the year ahead.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h4>Do some cooking</h4>
          <p>
            Matariki is traditionally a time to get together to share kai
            harvested from past seasons. Cook a mid-winter feast for friends and
            whānau using traditional Māori vegetables such as kumara, kamo kamo,
            taro, puha and uwhi. There are many other delicious foods you could
            cook as well.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h4>Do some stargazing</h4>
          <p>
            Pop outside one evening and see if you can see the Matariki star
            cluster. This helpful video shows you how to find Matariki by using
            other stars and constellations to point the way. Keep a look out for
            the nine stars.
